<p>The Moira River has 2 commonly run sections that are separated by a large stretch of flat water. Both can easily be run in a day. Most people run the Lost Channel, then take out and move downstream to run the Chisholm's Mill Section. The Moira can only be paddled for a short time during spring run off. The river is wide and shallow, it requires quite alot of water to produce sizeable rapids. The riverbed is a combination of large rocks and limestone shelves. Beginner to Intermediate; Class I to III

<h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Rapids </span></h2>
<p><b>The Put-in</b>
</p>
<p>Put-in anywhere along the shore shown in the picture. You can put-in below the meat, and use the eddy line to paddle up and peal out into the wave train. It is not advisable to run the dam here at any point.
</p>
<p><b>River Wide Wave Train</b>
</p>
<p>Follow the current down and just around the left corner shown here, is the 1st rapid, a river wide wave train. Avoid the big hits, or take it in the face, the river is wide here, and you can pick your way down.
</p>
<p><b>Channel Ledge</b>
</p>
<p>The river splits here. On river left is a channel known as the Scuttle Hole, and river right (shown here), is a channel wide ledge with some holes and large waves. Scout on river right.
</p>
<p><b>Scuttle Hole Channel</b>
</p>
<p>No real scouting is necessary here. There is not a whitewater paddler's "hole" on this channel. It is just a very fast channel of water, with a sharp right hand turn at the bottom and a small bit of white water.
</p>
<p><b>Take-Out</b>
</p>
<p>The river slows here, and this will be the area for take-out. It is advisable not to miss this take-out, as there is a sizeable dam downstream. There are alot of nice, long Class II-III rapids, which make-up the rest of the run, including a very nice rapid which breaks left, runs long and fast for 150M, then breaks to the right, only to continue for a short distance before slowing.
