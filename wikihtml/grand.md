The Grand River is a large river in southwestern Ontario, Canada. From
its source, it flows south through Grand Valley, Fergus, Elora,
Waterloo, Kitchener, Cambridge, Paris, Brantford, Caledonia, and Cayuga
before emptying into the north shore of Lake Erie south of Dunnville at
Port Maitland. One of the scenic and spectacular features of the river
is the falls and gorge at Elora.

The Grand River is the largest river entirely within southern Ontario's
boundaries. The river owes its size to the unusual fact that it has its
source relatively close to the base of the Bruce Peninsula, yet flows
southwards to Lake Erie, rather than to central Lake Huron or Georgian
Bay (most southern Ontario rivers flow into the nearest Great Lake,
which is why most of them are small), thus giving it more distance to
take in more water from tributaries.

The river's rural character, ease of access and lack of portages make it
a desirable canoeing location, especially the stretch between West
Montrose and Paris, Ontario. A number of conservation areas exist in the
area of the river, managed by the Grand River Conservation Authority.
