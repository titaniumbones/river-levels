<p>The Credit River watershed extends north and east of Lake Ontario from Port Credit in the south, to around the town of Orangeville in the north. Much of the river is apparently navigable. The journey from Orangeville in the North has been written up on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130620202405/http://www.creditvalleyca.ca/recandleisure/canoeing.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.creditvalleyca.ca/recandleisure/canoeing.htm" rel="nofollow">Credit Valley Conservation Area web site</a>. The section popular among white water enthusiasts is generally found to the south in Mississauga from the Streetsville area to Erindale Park. In this section, the river is banked on both sides by parkland and semi-wilderness and can be quite pretty. The section south of Erindale Park to Port Credit on Lake Ontario generally has less appealing scenery. Here, the river travels through some semi-wilderness, a golf course and eventually pours into a long, flat, man-made water way. The run from Erindale Park to Port Credit contains two short boulder gardens, but is generally slower moving and finishes with a flat water paddle of perhaps 3 km.
</p><p>The whitewater section from Streetsville to Erindale Park is  <a href="/web/20130620202405/http://www.whitewaterontario.ca:80/rivers/index.php/International_Scale_of_River_Difficulty#CII" title="International Scale of River Difficulty">Class II</a> but could be <a href="/web/20130620202405/http://www.whitewaterontario.ca:80/rivers/index.php/International_Scale_of_River_Difficulty#CIII" title="International Scale of River Difficulty">Class III</a> in spring flood due to the lack of eddies.

<p>Main Access Point:
</p><p>To access the Credit in Streetsville use the Streetsville Memorial Park access near the Vic Johnston Arena.
</p><p>Alternative Access Point: 
</p><p>An alternative access point is located below the Eglinton Ave West Bridge (Vehicle access through Culham Trail - entrance located at the SE end of the bridge). This access point allows you to enter just south of the Dam and misses no major features.

<p>Technical difficulty was not much more than class II, but due to the lack of eddies and a couple of hazards to dodge it is class III
</p><p>Main feature to be aware off is about 400m downstream of the put in.  Just around a bend is a major dam.  We skirted the dam using a channel on river left that was accessed before the dam was insight.  Dam is visible from google maps.

few play waves on the way. Good section of water for eddy hopping close to the takeout.

<p>The Moira River has 2 commonly run sections that are separated by a large stretch of flat water. Both can easily be run in a day. Most people run the Lost Channel, then take out and move downstream to run the Chisholm's Mill Section. The Moira can only be paddled for a short time during spring run off. The river is wide and shallow, it requires quite alot of water to produce sizeable rapids. The riverbed is a combination of large rocks and limestone shelves. Beginner to Intermediate; Class I to III

<p>
  <b>Put in</b>
</p>
<p>
  From Marmora, travel east on Hwy #7 to Hwy #37 Tweed. Follow Hwy #7 south through Tweed until you reach Roslin. Turn left onto Shannonville Road, follow until you pass Chisholm's Lumber, go over the bridge and park in the lot on the right hand side.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Take out</b>
</p>
<p>Go back out to Hwy #37 and continue south on Hwy #37 to Plainfield/Latta. Turn left onto Latta Road, follow to the Plainfield Store. Turn left right at the store on the small laneway. Park along the road, above the dam.
</p>
<a name="Rapids" id="Rapids"></a>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Rapids </span></h2>
<p><b>The Put-in</b>
</p>
<p>Put-in anywhere along the shore shown in the picture. You can put-in below the meat, and use the eddy line to paddle up and peal out into the wave train. It is not advisable to run the dam here at any point.
</p>
<p><b>River Wide Wave Train</b>
</p>
<p>Follow the current down and just around the left corner shown here, is the 1st rapid, a river wide wave train. Avoid the big hits, or take it in the face, the river is wide here, and you can pick your way down.
</p>
<p><b>Channel Ledge</b>
</p>
<p>The river splits here. On river left is a channel known as the Scuttle Hole, and river right (shown here), is a channel wide ledge with some holes and large waves. Scout on river right.
</p>
<p><b>Scuttle Hole Channel</b>
</p>
<p>No real scouting is necessary here. There is not a whitewater paddler's "hole" on this channel. It is just a very fast channel of water, with a sharp right hand turn at the bottom and a small bit of white water.
</p>
<p><b>Take-Out</b>
</p>
<p>The river slows here, and this will be the area for take-out. It is advisable not to miss this take-out, as there is a sizeable dam downstream. There are alot of nice, long Class II-III rapids, which make-up the rest of the run, including a very nice rapid which breaks left, runs long and fast for 150M, then breaks to the right, only to continue for a short distance before slowing.

<p>The Grand River is a large river in southwestern Ontario, Canada. From its source, it flows south through Grand Valley, Fergus, Elora, Waterloo, Kitchener, Cambridge, Paris, Brantford, Caledonia, and Cayuga before emptying into the north shore of Lake Erie south of Dunnville at Port Maitland. One of the scenic and spectacular features of the river is the falls and gorge at Elora.
</p><p>The Grand River is the largest river entirely within southern Ontario's boundaries. The river owes its size to the unusual fact that it has its source relatively close to the base of the Bruce Peninsula, yet flows southwards to Lake Erie, rather than to central Lake Huron or Georgian Bay (most southern Ontario rivers flow into the nearest Great Lake, which is why most of them are small), thus giving it more distance to take in more water from tributaries.
</p><p>The river's rural character, ease of access and lack of portages make it a desirable canoeing location, especially the stretch between West Montrose and Paris, Ontario. A number of conservation areas exist in the area of the river, managed by the Grand River Conservation Authority.
