** Intro
Proof-of-concept graph of data from NOAA's temporarily-out-of-service point forecast API

Some basic thoughts:

- graphing wateroffice data turns out to be easy once it's available: convert unix date-time to javascript Date object & graph. Improvements might include:
- use either `target-line` or maybe better, [[https://github.com/gionkunz/chartist-plugin-threshold][threshold]] plugin to identify periods of navigability.  cf. descriptions and examples on [[https://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/plugins.html][plugins page]].
  - threshold CSS and definition is working pretty well as of <2019-11-27 Wed> in the page generated below
- [[https://github.com/tmmdata/chartist-plugin-tooltip][tooltips plugin]] is a little less awesome than other frameworks:
  - no touch support!!
  - tooltips only show up on mouseover of *points*, not of areas.  This will be a real pain in these graphs.
  - not trivial to pass HTML to the tooltip, though it can be overcome by passing a function name [[https://github.com/tmmdata/chartist-plugin-tooltip#available-options-and-their-defaults][to the tooltipFnc options property]] on plugin initialization. The function takes towo parameters: *meta*, the value of the meta property, and *value*, the y-value. This turns out to be pretty inflexible, and probably rules out chartist for our purposes (sad b/c it was so easy to work with).
  - [[https://github.com/tmmdata/chartist-plugin-tooltip/pulls][lotso f outstanding PR's]] and [[https://github.com/tmmdata/chartist-plugin-tooltip/issues][issues]], doesn't appear to be very actively maintained.
- *thresholds/line segments*: If I really want to  use color to represent direction, then instead of threshold I have to use some kind of custom plugin -- I can write it! -- that deserializes meta and takes a value map on the  ~quality~~ property, then uses that to do the smae thing asthreshold (clone element & mask). I can't quite understand the threshold code, so would have to investigate further, but looks possible.  Note that all this work is done in the *on: draw* phase of chart construction, cf. https://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/getting-started.html#colour-up-your-charts, dynamic coloring
