<p>The Credit River watershed extends north and east of Lake Ontario from Port Credit in the south, to around the town of Orangeville in the north. Much of the river is apparently navigable. The journey from Orangeville in the North has been written up on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130620202405/http://www.creditvalleyca.ca/recandleisure/canoeing.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.creditvalleyca.ca/recandleisure/canoeing.htm" rel="nofollow">Credit Valley Conservation Area web site</a>. The section popular among white water enthusiasts is generally found to the south in Mississauga from the Streetsville area to Erindale Park. In this section, the river is banked on both sides by parkland and semi-wilderness and can be quite pretty. The section south of Erindale Park to Port Credit on Lake Ontario generally has less appealing scenery. Here, the river travels through some semi-wilderness, a golf course and eventually pours into a long, flat, man-made water way. The run from Erindale Park to Port Credit contains two short boulder gardens, but is generally slower moving and finishes with a flat water paddle of perhaps 3 km.

<p>Technical difficulty was not much more than class II, but due to the lack of eddies and a couple of hazards to dodge it is class III
</p><p>Main feature to be aware off is about 400m downstream of the put in.  Just around a bend is a major dam.  We skirted the dam using a channel on river left that was accessed before the dam was insight.  Dam is visible from google maps.
</p><p>Rest of the river was a long entertaining run.

</p><p>At 5.7 river is very high. Lots of features and all play waves are washed out. At lower levels(as low as 4.7) there are a 
few play waves on the way. Good section of water for eddy hopping close to the takeout.
